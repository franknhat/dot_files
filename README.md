Just my current dot files for my arch linux install

The customizations are just me wanting it and doing it. There is nothing really here and most of it is little customization

The point of this is for me to just cp if for whatever reason I needa reinstall arch again... gotta love rolling release :D Ive had to reinstall a couple times for diff reasons. Most recent was instability with Linux kernal so I had to swap to Linux-LTS.
